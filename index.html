    <h2>300 Word Bio</h2>
    <p>My name is Moriah Hartman and I am a college student studying Graphic Design at Eastern Washington University. I have been attending Eastern Washington University for 2 years now and I plan to graduate with my bachelor’s degree in the Winter of 2020. The degree I will be obtaining is a VCD major with a certificate in UX. With my bachelor's degree, I plan to find work in the field I have always loved, art and design.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include music, I play the piano, ukulele, and the guitar, sports, mainly volleyball, but I've done a variety, and of course art. As a child, I wanted to become a veterinarian when I got older because I love animals and I always have, but once I realized I might have to put animals down I did not think I could go through something like that so I went back to art. I used to believe that art would never be a career I could make for myself as a child, but when I finally got into college level classes I was able to understand that there is a wide variety of degrees one can obtain that relates closely to art.</p>
    <p>I plan to extend and challenge the limits of my artwork, not only in hands-on situations, but also technologically based. Most of my design experience involves doing homemade projects and exploring my creativity on my own. Obtaining a bachelor’s degree in Graphic Design will not only allow me to expand my creativity for my own interest, but also allow me to gain a greater knowledge of the business side of art and design. Beyond my degree I am still trying to determine where exactly it will take me, but I am keeping my horizons open to obtain the opportunity that awaits me.</p>
